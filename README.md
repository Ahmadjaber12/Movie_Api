# Movie_Api
Hello my friend and welcome to my profile ,In this project I make a full-stack project using (HTML,CSS,JavaScript,MongoDB,Nodejs,Express.js) .this project handles how to deal with Api's which we are using is Movie Api
We first make a two pages in HTML the first one is index.html which is for viewing cards ,each card holds the Movie name ,Picture and a link called Reviews ,this link leads to another page called Movie.html
which is basiclly for showing the Movie's Reviews,the user can add,edit,delete,retreive the reviews.
